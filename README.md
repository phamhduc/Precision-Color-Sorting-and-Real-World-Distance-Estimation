# Precision-Color-Sorting-and-Real-World-Distance-Estimation
This project is built for sorting colored object, estimate it's realworld distance base on the frame taken on the camera
The GUI is developed base on PyQt5 library in python, combined with opencv to implement application with Vision system
This application can detect a several color base on your HSV value that you input to the app.
It can detect 3 color set simultaneously, for more color set you can config the code base on my tutorial.
